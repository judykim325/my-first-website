    target="_blank"><strong>The words “design”</strong></a>  and “designer” are quite common in society, but they are not used very precisely. Most of us have heard of designer clothes or accessories, but apart from the greater expense what does that mean? The basic definition of the word “design” is simply to plan something in advance. So, almost all human artifacts are designed to a certain extent. Designer jeans or handbags are just the product of a designer or design studio with a sought-after reputation.
